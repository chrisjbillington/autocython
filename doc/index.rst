Introduction
------------

Like ``pyx_import``, but when you want to write your own setup.py still, and you want to keep the compiled extensions in the package directory.

"How is that at all like ``pyx_import``?" I hear you ask. "Why would I want that?".

Well, ``autocython`` records a hash of the ``.pyx`` files and the resulting ``.so`` or
``.pyd`` files whenever it compiles anything, and recompiles automatically (by
running your ``setup.py``) if it detects that there is a mismatch. So that's how it's
like ``pyx_import``.

The similarities end there. As mentioned, you have to write your own ``setup.py``. I
don't see this as much of a drawback, it's rare that I have a Cython extension that
doesn't need at least some customisation, and that customisation
might as well go in a separate file than in a call to ``pyx_import``. See the example
below for how to write a setup.py that works with ``autocython``.

``autocython`` expects you to keep all the compiled extensions in the same directory,
even for different versions of Python and platforms. Whilst keeping multiple
versions of extensions for different platforms in the same directory is easy in
Python 3 (since extensions get a platform-specific suffix), it is less easy in
Python 2. So ``autocython`` provides a platform-specific suffix that you can add to
the names of your extensions in your ``setup.py`` (see example below), and an import
function that uses the same suffix to import the right version at run time. This
allows distributing fat packages with all the supported compiled versions of the
extension in the same folder. Whilst it is bad practice to distribute packages like
this, it is often what is most convenient if you're a research group doing
numerical simulations or lab control systems and sharing code with each other
without wanting to think too hard about packaging or build servers.

But perhaps most importantly, ``autocython`` serves as a reminder to myself as to
the current state of compiling cython extensions on all platform. It calls your
``setup.py`` as: ``python setup.py build_ext --inplace``, or on Windows as ``python
setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=msvc``. So long as your ``setup.py`` imports
``setuptools``, on Windows this means you actually get a meaningful error about where
to download the correct compiler from Microsoft. Even if you get these steps wrong,
``autocython`` prints a big fat error message describing what you need to make sure
you've done, which I intend to update whenever the state of Windows compiling
changes.

.. note::
    As of March 2018, the compilers needed on Windows are available at:
    Python 2.7: http://aka.ms/vcpython27.
    Python 3.5+:"Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools", from http://aka.ms/BuildTools

------------
Installation
------------

to install ``autocython``, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install autocython

or to install from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 setup.py install

.. note::
    Works with Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+


-------------
Example usage
-------------

Below is an example of how to use autocython in a package. All recompilation is triggered by imports.

.. note::
    You can also check and trigger recompilation by running ``python -m
    autocython`` in the directory containing the ``.pyx`` files and your
    ``setup.py``. This can be a more convenient way to compile for a specific
    platform than having to actually run the program doing the imports.

This example has a top-level script ``example.py`` which imports the ``hello``
function from a package ``hello_package``:

.. code-block:: python

    # example.py

    from hello_package import hello
    hello()

That package's ``__init__.py`` imports the ``hello`` function from a Cython
extension ``hello_module.pyx`` using ``autocython``, after ensuring all extensions in
the folder are up to date:

.. code-block:: python

    # hello_package/__init__.py

    import os
    from autocython import ensure_extensions_compiled, import_extension
    this_folder = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    ensure_extensions_compiled(this_folder)
    hello_module = import_extension('hello_package.hello_module')
    hello = hello_module.hello

Note that it is important that the import line given to
:func:`~autocython.import_extension` is a fully qualified, absolute import. If you
are only using Python 3, :func:`~autocython.import_extension` is unnecessary
and you can just use a normal import line (though you should still use
:func:`~autocython.import_extension` if your code needs to run on both Python 2
and 3)

The Cython extension in the package is:

.. code-block:: python

    # hello_package/hello_module.pyx

    def hello():
        print('hello from cython!')

And the package directory also contains the ``setup.py`` for compiling the
extension:

.. code-block:: python

    # hello_package/setup.py

    from setuptools import setup
    from setuptools.extension import Extension
    from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

    from autocython import PLATFORM_SUFFIX

    ext_modules = [Extension("hello_module" + PLATFORM_SUFFIX, ["hello_module.pyx"])]
    setup(
        name = "hello_package",
        cmdclass = {"build_ext": build_ext},
        ext_modules = ext_modules,
    )

Use of ``setuptools`` is crucial on Windows, otherwise compilation will not be able
to find the Microsoft compilers. Importing :attr:`~autocython.PLATFORM_SUFFIX` and
appending it to the extension name allows each version of the extension to have a
platform- specific unique name on Python 2 (:func:`~autocython.import_extension`
makes sure it gets the right one at import time). If you are only using Python 3,
you don't need to add this suffix, but you still should if your code needs to run
on both Pytohn 2 and 3 (in Python 3 :attr:`~autocython.PLATFORM_SUFFIX` is just an
empty string)

The result of all this is:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example.py
    Extension(s) out of date, recompiling...
    <compilation output>
    hello from cython!

    $ python example.py # again, no compilation output this time:
    hello from cython!

    $ python3 example.py # different Python version:
    Extension(s) out of date, recompiling...
    <compilation output>
    hello from cython!

    $ python example.py # original Python again, still no recompilation neccesary:
    hello from cython!

    $ ls hello_package/ # See what files have been generated:
    autocython_compile_state.json                 hello_module.pyx  __pycache__
    hello_module.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so  __init__.py       setup.py
    hello_module_py27_linux2_64bit.so             __init__.pyc


-----------
Limitations
-----------

.. note::
    The following limitation only applies to Python 2.

When importing an extension from a package, provided that the package's
``__init__.py`` uses :func:`~autocython.import_extension`, then the extension will
be available for ordinary import. That is, in the above example, if ``example.py``
had instead imported the hello function with the line:

.. code-block:: python

    from hello_package.hello_module import hello
    hello()

everything would have still been fine. However, importing extensions in the
following way does not in general work with ``autocython``:

.. code-block:: python

    import hello_package.hello_module
    hello_package.hello_module.hello()

This may fail with ``AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute
'hello_module'``, since even though the import succeeded, Python thinks that
``hello_package.hello_module`` is getting an attribute from the ``hello_package``,
as opposed to being the name of a submodule. This is a side effect of
:func:`~autocython.import_extension` renaming the extension module after import to
remove :attr:`~autocython.PLATFORM_SUFFIX`.

The workaround, as done in the above example, is to ensure that ``hello_module``
`is` an attribute of ``hello_package``, by making the import line in your package's
``__init__.py`` look like:

.. code-block:: python

    hello_module = import_extension('hello_package.hello_module')

with the extension module assigned to a variable with the same name as the
extension module itself. If you do this then importers will be able to import the
extension module or its members using any of the different forms of the ``import``
statement.

----------------
Module reference
----------------

The public API comprises two functions and a constant:

.. autofunction:: autocython.ensure_extensions_compiled

.. autofunction:: autocython.import_extension

.. attribute:: autocython.PLATFORM_SUFFIX

    A platform-specific string that should be appended to extension names in
    ``setup.py`` (see above example) in order to make them uniquely named on a per-
    platform basis in Python 2. On Python 3 this is the empty string. On Python 2
    it is ``b'_py27_{}_{}'.format(sys.platform, platform.architecture()[0])``, leading to extensions with names like ``hello_module_py27_linux2_64bit.so``
